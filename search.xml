    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is my first post article, and I learned a lot when building my first personal blog.ðŸ¤£</p>
<p>About the purpose of building a blog, I just want to slow donw my step, and do somthing more about thinking,<br>recording and also it can be my working notes.ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>These days, I have realized that I â€˜m making more and more mistakes in my work, and most of those can easy to be avoided.ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”<br>The cause of this result is that I never have a plan before coding or doing other things, no plan, no framework, not strictly at all.</p>
<p>Although, I have some experience in game development since  I â€˜m in the University, but never do a systematic learning. And the consequence is that,<br>I lack a specialty of my profession.</p>
<p>Not only at work, the lack of notes makes me feel that I am losing everything of my life step by step, especially in a fast-paced life.</p>
<p>So, I hope my blog can not only make sense to my work, but to my life, to my fucking English learning.ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€</p>
